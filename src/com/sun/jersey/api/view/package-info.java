/**
 * Provides support for Model, View and Controller (MVC).
 * <p>
 * Given the MVC pattern the Controller corresponds to a resource class,
 * the View to a template referenced by a template name, and the Model
 * to a Java object (or a Java bean).
 * <p>
 * A resource method of a resource class may return an instance of 
 * {@link com.sun.jersey.api.view.Viewable} that encapsulates the template name 
 * and the model. In this respect the instance of
 * {@link com.sun.jersey.api.view.Viewable} is the response entity. Such a
 * viewable response entity may be set in contexts other than a resource
 * method but for the purposes of this section the focus is on resource methods.
 * <p>
 * The {@link com.sun.jersey.api.view.Viewable}, returned by a resource method,
 * will be processed such that the template name is resolved to a fully qualified
 * template name that identifies a template of a template processor.
 * 
 * The template processor then processes template given the model to produce a
 * response entity that is returned to the client.
 * <p>
 * For example, the template name could reference a Java Server Page (JSP) and
 * the model will be accessible to that JSP. The JSP template processor will
 * process the JSP resulting in an HTML document that is returned
 * as the response entity. (See later for more details.)
 * <p>
 * Two forms of returning {@link com.sun.jersey.api.view.Viewable} instances 
 * are supported: explicit; and implicit.
 *
 * <h2>Explicit views</h2>
 *
 * <h2>Implicit views</h2>
 *
 * <h2>Integration with Java Server Pages (JSPs)</h2>
