/**
 * Includes a side JSP file for the "resolvingClass" class.
 *
 * <p>
 * This tag looks for a side JSP file of the given name
 * from the inheritance hierarchy of the "resolvingClass" class,
 * and includes the contents of it, just like &lt;jsp:include>.
 *
 * <p>
 * For example, if the "resolvingClass" class is the <tt>Foo</tt> class,
 * which looks like the following:
 *
 * <pre>
 * class Foo extends Bar { ... }
 * class Bar extends Zot { ... }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * And if you write:
 * <pre><xmp>
 * <st:include page="abc.jsp"/>
 * </xmp></pre>
 * then, it looks for the following files in this order,
 * and includes the first one found.
 * <ol>
 *  <li>a side-file of the Foo class named abc.jsp (/WEB-INF/Foo/abc.jsp)
 *  <li>a side-file of the Bar class named abc.jsp (/WEB-INF/Bar/abc.jsp)
 *  <li>a side-file of the Zot class named abc.jsp (/WEB-INF/Zot/abc.jsp)
 * </ol>
