 * Service-provider interface for creating {@link RequestDispatcher} instances.
 * <p>
 * An implementation (a service-provider) identifies itself by placing a 
 * provider-configuration file (if not already present), 
 * "com.sun.research.ws.rest.spi.invoker.ResourceMethodDispatchProvider" in the 
 * resource directory <tt>META-INF/services</tt>, and including the fully qualified
 * service-provider-class of the implementation in the file.
 * <p>
 * A provider will examine the model of the Web resource method and 
 * determine if an invoker can be created for that Web resource method.
 * <p>
 * Multiple providers can specify the support for different Web resource method
 * patterns, ranging from simple patterns (such as void return and intput 
 * parameters) to complex patterns that take type URI and query arguments 
 * and HTTP reuqest headers as typed parameters.
