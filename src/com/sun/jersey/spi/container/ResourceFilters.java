/**
 * Defines the list of application-declared {@link ResourceFilter}
 * classes associated with a resource method, a sub-resource method,
 * or a sub-resource locator.
 * <p>
 * The classes will be instantiated as singleton components. Thus, if there
 * is the same class declared more than once in the same or a different
 * declaration of this annotation then only one instance of the class will be
 * instantiated.
 * <p>
 * This annotation can be specified on a class or on method(s). Specifying it
 * at a class level means that it applies to all the methods in the class.
 * Specifying it on a method means that it is applicable to that method only.
 * If applied at both the class and methods level , the method value overrides
 * the class value.
